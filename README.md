### Hey there!

My name is Lucas de Paula Melo, and I am a student at Fatec (Faculdade de Tecnologia de Franca), currently learning JavaScript, Java, and Python. As for the future, my objective would be to continue developing myself and begin my studies in C++ and Unreal Engine.

Would you like to find me?
